## Description

I had wanted to create this project for a while but I didn't have the time or the space. 
With the use of an Arduino, the color of the LEDs would turn on when the sound sensor picked up on noise. 
Depending one what frequecies were picked up a cetain part of the tree lit up. It was split into tiers. 
The first tier would pick up on the rartist singing the lyrics, the second ties would react when lighter beats played. 
The third tier would light up with heavier beats.
